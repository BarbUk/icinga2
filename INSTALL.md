# Installing Icinga 2

The recommended way of installing Icinga 2 is to use [packages](https://packages.icinga.com).
The Icinga project provides both release and development packages for a number
of operating systems.

Please check the documentation in the [doc/](doc/) directory for a current list
of available packages and detailed installation instructions.

The online documentation is available on [icinga.com/docs](https://icinga.com/docs/)
and will guide you step by step.

There are a number of known caveats when installing from source such as
incorrect directory and file permissions. So even if you're planning to
not use the official packages it is advisable to build your own Debian
or RPM packages. You can use the source packages from [packages.icinga.com](https://packages.icinga.com)
for this purpose.

For a more detailed introduction into developing Icinga and building
packages, please visit the [online documentation](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga2/latest/doc/21-development/).
